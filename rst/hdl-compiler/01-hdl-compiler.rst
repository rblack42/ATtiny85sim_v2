HDL Compiler
############

We will be defining the architecture of this simulator using a
simple ``Hardware Description Language``. We will define the
parts and connecitons needed using a text file that must be
processed to construct the actul machine we will simulate.

To get from the test file to a running machine, er need a tool
that can process the definition file, and assemble the parts. The
design of this tool is based on common techniques used in
building compilers.
